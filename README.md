## Social Chess Tournament Generator

This project will provide a Flask application that will allow someone to create and manage a 3-hour chess
tournament for fun among a range of playing abilities.



### Basic Requirements

- A single individual must be able to generate the pairings instantly and manage the results from a phone
- There should be a page that functions as a leaderboard, to track the results of the tournament in process
- The players should be saved in a database so they can be re-used across events
- As the events are social, players should not play two rounds in a row, but alternate to give them time to eat, drink, and socialize
